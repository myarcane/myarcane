## About Me üëã

Hi! I'm **Florian** and I am **senior Frontend Engineer**. Early **2023**, I became a new canadian permanent resident üá®üá¶. Before that, I was based in the south of France üá´üá∑ and worked at [dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com/) for 8+ years as an individual contributor in the player craft.  

* I grew up in [Paris, France](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=48.884808,2.335369) and lived 5 years in [Mallorca, Spain](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=39.567114,2.646143) when I was a teenager. I also lived in [Antibes, France](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?maps/search/?api=1&query=39.567114,2.64614343.578053,7.123383) the last 10 years and now settled down in [Toronto, Canada](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?maps/search/?api=1&query=43.648095,-79.396904).
* üßó Climber since 2015. Love this sport. I discovered so many beautiful outdoor places through it.
* üèÇ When there is a good powder day, I also love to go snowboarding.
* üìö I love to read about philosophy, personal growth or training climbing books. 
* üè´ I have a masters degree in Web consulting and Science in information management but I prefer coding in general and craft things for the web. I'm mainly a self taught developer and I love to learn new things.

### Workflow

#### How do you start your working day?

* I first check my DMs in Slack, then my top-priority slack channels
* I do a first pass at my emails: I first looked at the ones that explicitely mentions me and opens all the issues/PRs associated with them.
* I then usually list all my TODOS for the day and share it my colleagues in a dedicated slack Daily Scrum channel.   
* I start working on the most important task on the list

#### How do you prepare for meetings?

* I use a slack outlook plugin to remind me that a (zoom) meeting is about to start in 30 minutes. 
* Reread the agenda before the meeting.  

#### How do you make async work happen in practice?

* I try to be as transparent as possible about my daily TODOs and keep my calendar up to date so the people I'm working with can have a clear vision of what I'm doing.
* Usually I try to address DMs in slack very quickly. It might still be a synchronous habit but it is still my way of working.
* I try to document as much as possible my work on various supports: wiki, github, Jira ...
* I also try to refuse meetings that are not useful to get my core tasks done. I can always catch up the zoom recording when I have extra time.   

### Tools

#### What tools do you use to keep track of the stuff that cannot be in a Github issue (paper, TODO lists, apps, ...)
* I recently started using [any.do](https://www.any.do/) for my personal todos. I like it because it is simple. 
* For my grocery list I use an app called [paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) to store my favourite recipes and generate automatically grocery list based on the recipe I want to make. 

#### What are the tools installed on your mac that you cannot live without?

* Chrome.
* Visual Studio Code.
* Iterm.
* Spotify.
* 1Password.
* ExpressVPN.
* IM: Slack for work, WhatsApp, Telegram for private.

#### Do you have workflows that you are proud of and/or relying on constantly

* I use git exclusively from command line, with a few aliases (`git br`, `git ba`, `git cm`, `git co`, `git st`, `git ru`).
* I developed a NodeJS command line tool to easily open PRs with a predefined template with the option of adding a funny GIF to the PR.  

#### What are the browser extensions that you cannot live without?

* 1password
* Adblock
* JSON formatter
* Okta
* any.do
* The QR Code Extension

### Text editor

#### What is your text editor?

* I use Visual studio code for most of my development work.
* I use VIM for commit message editing and interactive rebase.
